# PYPE_AP_2p
Visual stimulus control for awake monkey 2-photon imaging experiment

### History
Pype2: Original software was developed by Gallant lab at Berkeley. The original repo can be found [here](https://github.com/mazerj/pype2).  
Pype2_AP: The software was used in ShapeLab at UW. It was modified for specific hardware and experimental design. e.g. eye tracking hardware, recording system, network communication.  
Pype3: Gallant lab update the software for Python 3 support. The repo is [here](https://github.com/mazerj/pype3).  
Pype_AP: Pype2_AP was also updated for python 3 support, but the development path diverge from PYPE3. 

### TPYPE_AP_2p: 
Starting with Pype_AP, the software is modified for experiment using a homemade 2p microscope.  
It also supports a customized eye-tracking system based on Openris ([here](https://github.com/ocular-motor-lab/OpenIris) for the base software and [here](https://github.com/ryan-ressmeyer/OpenIrisDPI) for DPI plugin)
